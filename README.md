2. Please follow the code style rule like programs on handout.
3. Overdue homework submission could not be accepted.
4. Takes academic honesty and integrity seriously (Zero Tolerance of Cheating & Plagiarism)


1.	Write a high order function to make withdrawal from the balance in bank account by nonlocal variable.

def mk_wd(balance):
    """
    Return the balance after withdrawal since inception
    >>> rem = mk_wd (100)         # deposit $100 
    >>> rem(10)
    90
    >>> rem (20)
    70
    >>> rem (100)
   'Insufficient funds'
   """


2.	Write a function that deletes all instances of an element from a list. 

def  rm_all(elem, lst): 
""" 
>>> x = [3, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 7] 
>>> rm_all (1, x) 
>>> x 
[3, 2, 5, 7] 
"""


3. Write a function that takes in three arguments x, elem, and a list, and adds as many "elem"s to the end of the list as there are xâ€™s. 

def add_many(x, elem, lst): 
""" 
Adds elem to the end of lst the number of times x occurs in lst. 
>>> lst = [1, 2, 4, 2, 1] 
>>> add_many (2, 5, lst) 
>>> lst 
[1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 5, 5]

4. Write a function to create a new list from given a "suits" list and a number list

def  f (suits, numbers):
"""Creates a new list (2-element list as one element in a new list) with the given suits and numbers. Each element in the returned list should be of the form [suit, number].
    >>> f (['S', 'C'], [1, 2, 3])
    [['S', 1], ['S', 2], ['S', 3], ['C', 1], ['C', 2], ['C', 3]]

    []
    >>> f (['S', 'C'], [])

5. Write a function to merge 2 sorted lists a and b, and then return a new list with a sorted order by RECURSIVE calls.

def mrg(ls1, ls2):
    """Merges two sorted lists recursively.

    >>> mrg ([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6])

6. Write the function to flatten the deep list.

def fltn(ls):
    """Return a new version of list as follows.

    >>> fltn ([1, 2, 3])     		# normal list
    [1, 2, 3]

    >>> fltn (x)
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

7. Define a function to check if the element exists in the list or not.

def   chk_elm(lst, n): 
"""
>>> a = [ [1,[2]], 3, [ [4], [5,[6] ] ]   ] 
>>> chk_elm (a, 6)
True

8. Write a function to check whether the input argument list is symmetric or not in recursive call.

def sym(l):
    """Returns whether a list is symmetric or not
    >>> sym ([])
    True
    >>> sym ([1])
    True

    >>> sym ([1, 4, 4, 1])
    True
    >>> sym (['l', 'o', 'l'])
    True
    """


9. Write a function in recursive call that takes in a list lst, a function g, and an initial value m. This function will fold lst starting at the beginning. If lst is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] then the function g is applied as follows:

g (g (g (g (g (m, 1), 2), 3), 4), 5)

from operator import add, sub, mul

def fld (lst, g, m):
"""Return the result of applying the function g to the initial value m     and the first element in lst, and repeatedly applying g to this result and the next element in lst until it reaches the end of the list.

    6

    >>> fld ([], sub, 100)   	# return m if s is empty

10. Implement a function to create 2D array as follows

def   crte_2d_arr(rows, columns):
    """
    >>> crte_2d_arr(3, 5)
    [['-', '-', '-', '-', '-'], ['-', '-', '-', '-', '-'], ['-', '-', '-', '-', '-']]
